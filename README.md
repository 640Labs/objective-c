# PubNub 4.0b1 for iOS 7+

### Changes from 3.x
* 4.0 is a non-bw compatible REWRITE with 96% less lines of code than our 3.x!
* Removed support for iOS 6 and earlier
* Removed support for JSONKit
* Removed custom connection, request, logging, and reachability logic, replacing with NSURLSession, DDLog, and AFNetworking libraries
* Simplified serialization/deserialization threading logic
* Removed support for blocking, syncronous calls (all calls are now async)
* Simplified usability by enforcing completion block pattern -- client no longer supports Singleton, Delegate, Observer, Notifications response patterns
* Replaced configuration class with setter configuration pattern
* Consolidated instance method names
 
### Known issues and TODOs in beta1:

* Needs better handling for invalid API keys (right now fails with undefined error)
* Client should not allow duplicate channel names in subscribe field
*Not all status field attributes are being populated at Status emission time for all operations (will address via TDD)
* Ability to turn logging completely off
* Make libz.dylib added to project automatically at pod install time
* Verify HTTP pipelining behavior
* Prevent suspended dispatch queue instability when released if it contains unexecuted blocks
* Audit larger methods -- refactor into smaller where possible
* Revising Result/Status model for a more consistent behavior across all completion blocks and listener blocks, for error and non-errors
* Provide additional examples in Tutorial App
* Implement a generic status catch for non 200/403 responses
* Constantize / Objectize result.data keys
* Provide Swift Bridge and associated docs
* Provide standalone framework and static library versions of lib
* Approach >= 80% automated test code coverage as we approach final beta

## Installing the Source

* Create a new project in Xcode as you would normally.
* Close XCode
* Open a terminal window, and cd into your project directory.
* Create a Podfile. This can be done by running
```
touch Podfile
```

* Open your Podfile.
* Populate it with:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'AFNetworking', '~> 2.5'
pod 'CocoaLumberjack'
pod 'PubNub', :path => '/Users/gcohen/clients/objective-c'
```

* Be sure the path argument in the Podfile is pointing to the [parent directory](https://github.com/pubnub/objective-c/tree/4.0b1) the [PubNub source directory](https://github.com/pubnub/objective-c/tree/4.0b1/PubNub) lives in.

* Run:
 ```
 pod install
 ```

* Open the MyApp.xcworkspace that was created with XCode. (Don't open the project! Be sure to open the workspace ... This will be the file you use to write your app.)

You should now have a skeleton PubNub project.

## Hello World

* Open the workspace
* Select myApp in the folder view
* Under **Build Phases**, under **Link Binary with Libraries**, add ```libz.dylib``` with status of required
* Open AppDelegate.m
* Just after ```#import``` add the PubNub import:
 
```objective-c
#import "PubNub.h"
```
* Within the AppDelegate interface, make AppDelegate conform to the PNObjectEventListener protocol, and define a client property. When you are finished, it should look like this:

```objective-c
@interface AppDelegate () <PNObjectEventListener>
@property(nonatomic, strong) PubNub *client;
@end
```

* Make your application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions look like this:

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    self.client = [PubNub clientWithPublishKey:@"demo" andSubscribeKey:@"demo"];

    [self.client subscribeToChannels:@[@"myChannel"] withPresence:NO andCompletion:^(PNStatus *status) {
        
        if (!status.isError) {
            NSLog(@"^^^^ Subscribe request succeeded at timetoken %@.", status.currentTimetoken);
            
            [self.client publish:@"I'm here!" toChannel:@"myChannel"
                  withCompletion:^(PNStatus *status) {
                      if (!status.isError) {
                          NSLog(@"Message sent at TT: %@", status.data[@"tt"]);
                      } else {
                          // analyze the status object for next steps -- See Tutorial1 for in-depth examples
                      }
                  }];
            
        } else {
            NSLog(@"^^^^ Subscribe request did not succeed. All subscribe operations will autoretry when possible.");
            // analyze the status object for next steps -- See Tutorial1 for in-depth examples
        }
    }];
    

    return YES;
}
```
