 @discussion Synchronization API allow to specify path to piece of remote object information on 
             which client should be synchronized and observe changes on it. This method allow
             to retrieve list of all paths for which synchronization has been started.

 \b Example:
 
 @code

                         been started.

         invalidated or never synchronized yet. Empty array will be returned in case if whole
         remote object has been synchronized with object which locally represent it 
         (\b PNObject). List of data paths will be returned in case if synchronization has been
         launched for paerticular piece of remote object.

 @param objectIdentifier  Remote data object identifier for which data should be removed.
 @param location          Remote object's data location key-path inside of \b PubNub cloud.
                          In case if \c nil has been provided, \b PubNub client will try to 
                          remove all data stored in remote object's root node inside of \b PubNub
                          cloud.
 @param handlerBlock      Callback block called during data removal process state updates.
                          The block takes two arguments: \c objectInformation -
                          contains information about object for which client tried to remove
                          piece of data in \b PubNub cloud, data location key-path if data 
                          should be removed at concrete location; \c error - describes what 
                          exactly went wrong (check error code and compare it with
                          \b PNErrorCodes ).
 
 @note In case if client syncrhonized with object for which data has been removed, it will be
       updated only on synchronization event and not at the moment of this request processing
       completion.
