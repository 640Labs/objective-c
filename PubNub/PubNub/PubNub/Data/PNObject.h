/**
 @brief      Class used to represent locally object which is stored in \b PubNub cloud.
 
 @discussion \b PubNub cloud store objects using their unique name (like root folder name). All
             data stored internally at key paths as simple values or collections.
 
 @note       This instance doesn't own cached data and it can be invalidated any moment in case
             if cache will purge object from local storage (it may happen in case of 
             synchronization termination for example).
 
 @warning    If object has been provided by synchronization API and been invalidated, it also 
             mean that the only reference on object which is left is your code (which may store
             is somewhere in property).
