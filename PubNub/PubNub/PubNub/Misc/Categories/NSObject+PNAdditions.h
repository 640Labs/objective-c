 @brief      Receive \b PubNub defined index for object which has been received from list.
 
 @discussion Remote object in \b PubNub cloud is able to store lists (locally represented by 
             \a NSArray) and this method allow to retrieve index of concrete entry but in context
             of \b PubNub cloud.
             Received index also can be used as part of modification path.

 @code
 // Reference on list received from PNObject (after synchronization) or from PNObjectInformation
 // in case if data has been requested manually.
 NSArray *entries = ....;
 NSString *entryPubNubIndex = [entries[0] pn_index]; // Will assign something like this: -!14169947586481522
 @endcode
 
 @return Array entry index from \b PubNub cloud context (NSArray index is 0..N and \b PubNub 
         indices like this -!14169947586481522)
