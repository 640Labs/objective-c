/**
 @brief      Construct new \b PubNub client instance with pre-defined configuration.
 @discussion If all keys will be specified, client will be able to read and modify data on 
             \b PubNub service.
 @note       Client will make configuration deep copy and further changes in \b PNConfiguration 
             after it has been passed to the client won't take any effect on client.
 @note       All completion block and delegate callbacks will be called on main queue.
 @note       All required keys can be found on https://admin.pubnub.com

 @code
