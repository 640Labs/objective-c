/**
 @brief      Base class which is used to build communication with \b PubNub service and deliver 
             required portion of data to processing methods within client itself.
 @discussion This class used as initial API call point which receive information about remote 
             resource path and parameters required to access it through \b PubNub service.
             At the end of request processing it is updated with processing result (service
             response, pre-processed data and error if passed).
             After processing this object is used as part of \b PNResult and \b PNStatus to provide
             additional information which may be required during retry / debug stage.
